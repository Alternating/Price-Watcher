# Price-Watcher

- first install dependencies - npm i in the price-watcher root folder
- Edit the settings.json and save it with your discord bot token and user#
- edit the link with your bot's client id and invite your bot to your server-
- https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ChAng3M3&scope=bot&permissions=67109888


Work that is needed
-update bot.js to use a variable that is set in the settings file - currently hardcoded for each coin
-one script to host price checks on all coins in the settings file???
